## The Plugins

### Countdown Timer

Counts down for a specified amount of time, optionally emitting other messages during the countdown.

Usage: `!countdown -d <duration> -i <interval> [options]`

Duration and interval can be specified by an integer and unit; for example, '4m' (four minutes), '2h' (two hours), '45s' (forty-five seconds). Duration is the length of the countdown; interval is the interval at which the countdown will be updated. For example, `!countdown -d 10s -i 1s` will result in the following:

	10 seconds remaining...
	9 seconds remaining...
	8 seconds remaining...
	7 seconds remaining...
	6 seconds remaining...
	5 seconds remaining...
	4 seconds remaining...
	3 seconds remaining...
	2 seconds remaining...
	1 second remaining...
	Finished!

Other options include 

* -f (--finish) - specifies the message to emit when the countdown is finished.
* -e (--events) - a list of other messages to emit during the countdown, at specified times. For example, `!countdown -d 5s -i 1s -e 4s Almost Done...` will result in the following output:

		5 seconds remaining...
		4 seconds remaining...
		3 seconds remaining...
		2 seconds remaining...
		1 second remaining...
		Almost Done...
		Finished!

### Reminder

Emits a reminder message at the specified time.

Usage: `!reminder [time] [message]`

[time] should be in the format HH:MM (24-hour clock). At the specified time, the bot will emit [message] into the chat room.
